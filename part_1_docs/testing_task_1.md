### Testing task 1:

# Carry out static testing on the code below.
# Comment on any errors that you see below.

Note that we are only looking for errors here.

**Not** any issues with, i.e.: 
Thinking that methods should be renamed or should be class level, or using string interpolation etc. 

These aren't errors but rather standards that vary from developer to developer. 

Only comment on errors that would stop the tests running.

```python

class CardGame:


  def check_for_ace(self, card):
    # Should be == not =
    if card.value = 1:
      return True
    # Missing a colon after else
    else
      return False
   
  # Def not dif and missing comma after card1
  dif highest_card(self, card1 card2):
  if card1.value > card2.value:
    # Should be card1
    return card
  else:
    return card2
  
def cards_total(self, cards):
  # Should be total = 0
  total
  for card in cards:
    total += card.value
    # Needs to be str(total), and have a space after of, and be indented left outside of the loop
    return "You have a total of" + total
  
```
